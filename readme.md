## List of modifications

01 - JS Drum Kit

- Drums respond to click events

02 - JS and CSS Clock

- Clock hands have various length

03 - CSS Variables

- Initial values of input elements sync up with CSS vars
- Inputs update values only when mouse button is pressed

05 - Flex Panel Gallery

- Panels expand on 'mouseover' instead of 'click'.
- Opening a panel closes the previous one.
- more dynamic CSS transitions.

06 - Type Ahead

- Results are sorted by a selected property

07 - Array Cardio 2

- find() and findIndex() are abstracted

08 - Canvas

- Actions can be undone

10 - Checkboxes

- Clicking two boxes while holding Shift checks OR UNCHECKS all boxes in between, to match the state of the first box clicked
- The same operation is performed on subsequent clicks as long as shift is held (matching the very first box)

12 - keyLog

- Arbitrary number of availble keywords
- If the key sequence matches multiple keywords, the recently matched one takes precedence (e.g. gold < goldenrod)
- Longer keywords have higher precedence (red < darkred)

13 - Slide in on Scroll

- Bugfix: On each scroll, images react to the window's final position, rather than initial
- Images start sliding as soon as they appear on screen - not when they're halfway in
- Custom debounce function (for the sake of practice)

16 - Mouse Move shadow

- interactive text-shadow size and blur with variable parameters
- responsive font size
- TODO: input field for variables
